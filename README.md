## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS
- tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React Router] - For routing
- [useFetch] - Custom hook for fetching data
- [ThemeContext] - For managing theme
- [ReactIcons] - For icons

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I delved into various aspects of frontend development, honing my skills in React by implementing custom hooks like useFetch for efficient data fetching and managing state. Additionally, I expanded my understanding of higher-order components, which played a crucial role in structuring reusable logic across the application.

In terms of styling, I leveraged Tailwind CSS to streamline the design process and ensure consistency in styling components. Moreover, I focused on adhering to accessibility best practices by implementing ARIA attributes in components such as the search bar and filter box, thus enhancing the user experience for individuals with disabilities.

### Continued development

Looking ahead, I'm keen on further optimizing the performance of the application, exploring techniques to minimize bundle size and improve loading times. Additionally, I aim to delve deeper into accessibility considerations, continually refining my approach to ensure inclusivity for all users.
